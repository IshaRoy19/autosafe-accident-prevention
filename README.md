Project Overview

This project is designed to develop a distance-based automatic braking system using:

Arduino UNO

Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)

DC motor & motor driver


The ultrasonic sensor detects the distance between the vehicle and obstacles. Based on this distance:

Distance > 5m → Move at normal speed

Distance 2–5m → Slow down

Distance ≤ 2m → Stop


Problem Statement

Road accidents are often caused by delayed human reaction.

Need for a system that detects obstacles and responds in real-time.



Importance and Need

Improve Road Safety – Real-time braking can prevent accidents.

Low Cost – Uses affordable components like Arduino and HC-SR04.

Smart Simulation – Mimics features in modern intelligent braking systems.



Methodology

The system is built on:

Real-time distance sensing (ultrasonic)

Speed control logic

Embedded control using Arduino



Components Used

Arduino UNO

Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)

L298N Motor Driver

DC motors

9V battery

Jumper wires

Mini car chassis (optional)

Working Principle

1. The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance from the obstacle.


2. Arduino processes the data and takes one of three actions:

Move normally

Slow down

Stop the vehicle


How to Run

1. Build the circuit using the provided diagram.


2. Upload the code to Arduino using the Arduino IDE.


3. Power the setup and test obstacle distances.

  
4. Adjust logic if needed to simulate different vehicle behaviors.




Future Improvements

Add buzzer/alert system for warnings.

Use IR sensors for better precision.

Integrate GPS/GSM for accident alerts.
